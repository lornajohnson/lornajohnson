- 👋 Hi, I’m @lornajohnson
- 👀 I’m interested in conversational AI in a healthcare context.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning RASA in order to build a virtual assistant for people with chronic conditions like Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (which I have).
- 💞️ I’m on the Data Science Dream Job programme and have done the study path for Data Analyst.   In parallel to DSDJ I did a couple of courses on Creative AI 
and conversational interfaces and, wanting to help others with the same health condition as myself, decided that this virtual assistant would be my first proper project.
- 📫 How to reach me ...  Email lorna@lindumresearch.co.uk
